Description

Assume the coasting is an infinite straight line. Land is in one side of coasting, sea in the other. Each small island is a point locating in the sea side. And any radar installation, locating on the coasting, can only cover d distance, so an island in the sea can be covered by a radius installation, if the distance between them is at most d. 

We use Cartesian coordinate system, defining the coasting is the x-axis. The sea side is above x-axis, and the land side below. Given the position of each island in the sea, and given the distance of the coverage of the radar installation, your task is to write a program to find the minimal number of radar installations to cover all the islands. Note that the position of an island is represented by its x-y coordinates.

Figure A Sample Input of Radar Installations

Input

The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains two integers n (1<=n<=1000) and d, where n is the number of islands in the sea and d is the distance of coverage of the radar installation. This is followed by n lines each containing two integers representing the coordinate of the position of each island. Then a blank line follows to separate the cases. 

The input is terminated by a line containing pair of zeros 
Output

For each test case output one line consisting of the test case number followed by the minimal number of radar installations needed. "-1" installation means no solution for that case.
Sample Input

3 2
1 2
-3 1
2 1

1 2
0 2

0 0
Sample Output

Case 1: 2
Case 2: 1

题意：x轴是海岸线，上方是海平面，下方是陆地，点是岛，求在海岸线布置最少的雷达覆盖所有的岛。
做法：把每个岛在岸上对应的区间求出，并从小到大排序。
